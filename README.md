   Advantages:
   - Clear structure and documentation.
   - Easy to manage due to its rigidity.
   
   Disadvantages:
   - Difficult to accommodate changes.
   - Testing occurs late in the process.


4. Project Planning:
   - Explain the key components of project planning in software project management. What tools and techniques are commonly used to create a project plan?

   Answers: 
   
   1. Scope:
   * Define project boundaries.
   * List deliverables and objectives.
   * Create Work Breakdown Structure (WBS).

   2. Schedule:
   * Develop a detailed timeline with milestones.
   * Use Gantt charts and timelines.

   3. Budget:
   * Estimate costs for resources, materials, and equipment.
   * Develop a budget plan

   4. Risk Management:
   * Identify potential risks.
   * Assess the impact and likelihood of each risk.
   * Develop risk mitigation strategies.

   5. Tools and Techniques:
   * Project management software (e.g.,Microsoft Project, Jira).
   * Critical Path Method (CPM).
   * Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT).


5. Risk Management:
   - What is risk management in the context of software projects? Outline the process of identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks.

   Answers: 

   Risk management in software development is the process of identifying, accessing, defining response strategy, monitoring, and finally, responding according to your strategy - either accepting, transferring, mitigating or avoiding them to ensure project success.

   Process:
   Identification:
   - Brainstorm potential risks.
   - Use risk checklists.
   
   Assessment:
   - Evaluate the probability and impact of each risk.
   - Use risk matrices.
   
   Mitigation:
   - Develop response plans for high-priority risks.
   - Assign risk owners.


6. Resource Management:
   - Discuss the importance of resource management in software projects. How do project managers ensure that resources are allocated efficiently?

   Answers:
   
   - Resource management is important to be able to monitor, and attain what is required to deliver projects
   - Ensures optimal use of human, financial, and material resources.
   - Prevents resource overallocation and bottlenecks. 
   
   Managers can ensure that resources are allocated efficiently by the following:
   
   Techniques:
   
   Resource Allocation:
 -  Assign resources based on project needs and priorities.
 
  Resource Leveling:
  - Adjust start and end dates based on resource availability.
  - Critical Path Method (CPM):
  - Identify the longest path of planned activities to the end of the project.


7. Quality Management:
   - Explain the role of quality management in software projects. What practices and standards are typically employed to ensure the quality of the software product?

   Answers:
   
   Role:
   - Ensures that the project deliverables meet the required standards and satisfy customer expectations
   
   Practices:
   Quality Assurance (QA):
   * Process-oriented approach.
   * Focuses on preventing defects.
   
   Quality Control (QC):
   * Product-oriented approach.
   * Focuses on identifying defects in the final product. 
   
   Standards:
   ISO 9001:
   * International standard for quality management systems.
   
   - CMMI (Capability Maturity ModelIntegration): Framework for improving process maturity.


8. Project Monitoring and Control:
   - How do project managers monitor and control the progress of a software project? Describe some key performance indicators (KPIs) and tools used for this purpose.

   Answers:
   
   - Project managers monitor and control the progress of a software project through key performance indicators(KPIâ€™s). KPIs are quantifiable measures that can indicate whether or not key aspects of the project are meeting the overall goals of the project.
   
   Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
   
   Schedule Variance (SV):
   * Measures the difference between planned and actual progress.

   Use of Collaboration Tools:
   - Platforms like Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Zoom facilitate communication and collaboration. 


10. Project Closure:
    - What are the steps involved in the closure of a software project? Why is the project closure phase important, and what activities are typically performed during this phase?

    Answers:
